# HKUST-MAFS-6010U-Project
This is the MAFS 6010U project about NLP chatbot of our team Outliers.

start.py: code to start the spider
items.py: code of spider
middlewares.py: code of spider
pipelines.py: code of spider
settings.py: code of spider
text_process.py: code to process the data and run the chatbot


To realize the chatbot function, we:
1. Run the “start.py” file to download the data.
2. Run “text_process.py” to run the chatbot.

Be careful, in the text_process file, the path is based on the personal path. We you run the chatbot, you have to revise the path of the data and then run.
