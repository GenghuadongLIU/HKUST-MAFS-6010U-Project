                Stephen Fitzpatrick is an entrepreneur who believes business has a crucial role to play in creating a zero carbon world. In 2009, he founded OVO Energy, which is committed to eliminating its own carbon emissions and helping its customers to reach net zero emissions at home by 2030. Since its founding, OVO has held a vision of clean, affordable energy for everyone. 
OVO’s intelligent technology division, Kaluza, is driving the global transition to a distributed and secure, zero-carbon grid. In 2018, Kaluza developed the world’s first domestic electric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charger.
Stephen is also the founder of  Vertical Aerospace, an electric aircraft company whose latest prototypes are reimagining the way we fly.
Last year, he launched the Zero Carbon Campaign to determine how carbon pricing can help drive the UK’s transition to net zero.
