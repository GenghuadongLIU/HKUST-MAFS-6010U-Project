What are virtual side events?
Side events are an engaging and interactive option for partners looking to connect with key stakeholders or prospect clients. Side events will be hosted in virtual ‘break out’ rooms, where the host will have a view of all of the participants, which will be kept between 10-50 people. The term ‘side event’ is the umbrella term used to describe a variety of sessions, described below.

What support do we offer?
CogX takes care of all the technical aspects of hosting a side event. In addition, we can offer support on some of the more time-consuming aspects of putting together a successful event. The activities we can help with include:
• Editorial & content curation
• Audience insights
• Marketing support
For organisations that wish to have their brand on the agenda, but want a more light-touch experience, we have a list of ready-made side-events that need sponsoring. This will mean your brand will appear as a banner in the virtual break out room the session is hosted in.

Why host a side event?
The benefit of hosting a side event is that you get to shape the agenda, content, speakers and invitations, to drive the conversation forward, in whatever goal you are currently pursuing:
