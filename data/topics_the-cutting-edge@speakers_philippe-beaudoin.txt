                About Philippe
                
                Philippe is a serial entrepreneur with a love for innovative ideas that have a positive impact on society. In 2016, he co-founded Element AI, a world leader at operationalizing Artificial Intelligence for businesses. In his latest venture, founded in early 2020, Philippe and his team are creating an “Empathetic AI” that curates personalized content “for the person we wish we were.” This new startup, still operating in stealth mode, recently secured seed funding from Founder Fuel, one of Canada’s most prominent tech accelerators. The team is now developing a novel approach to content discovery based on Natural Language Understanding to empower users and allow them to take control of the algorithms that have become so prominent in our lives. Philippe holds a Ph.D from Université de Montréal, and did his postdoc studies at University of British Columbia. He has worked as a software engineer, researcher and an executive for several companies including Google.
