                About Dr. Charmaine
                
                Charmaine re-joins the BHF as our Chief Executive from the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) where she had a range of strategic and operational responsibilities; most recently as Chief Operating Officer. The ICR is one of the world’s most influential cancer research organisations, with more than 1100 scientists and staff and an income of more than £140m. 
She also holds leadership roles for several ambitious initiatives, including the London Cancer Hub and the pioneering new £75m Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery.
Charmaine did her PhD and postdoctoral research in Neuroscience at University College London, alongside working in public engagement for the Wellcome Trust. Her subsequent career at the BHF included roles spanning communications, policy and assurance, as well as strategy.
Her non-executive experience includes roles at the Human Tissue Authority, the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Brain Research UK and the Cranfield Trust. Charmaine led the development of our previous organisational strategy, winning the Best Strategic Transformation category at the Chief Strategy Officer Awards 2014.
