                About Joanna
                
                Joanna Haigh is an atmospheric physicist and for 5 years co-Director of the Grantham Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London. Previously, she was Head of Imperialâ€™s Physics Department. She has published widely in the area of climate modelling and radiative forcing of climate change; her work on how changes in solar activity influence the climate has been particularly influential. 
She is a Fellow of the Royal Society, the Institute of Physics (IoP) and the City & Guilds Institute and an Honorary Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford and of the Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS) of which she is also a past-President. She has been a Lead Author for the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and shares a Nobel Peace Prize with several hundred others for that work. She has been awarded the IoP Chree Medal and Prize, and the RMetS Adrian Gill Prize, for her work on the interface between atmospheric science and solar physics, and was appointed CBE for her services to physics in 2013.
