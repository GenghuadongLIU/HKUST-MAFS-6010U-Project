                            Our planet is a complex system, and its health is integral to ours. COVID-19 has shown us that in the face of imminent threat, radical action is possible. In the long term, climate change represents one of the biggest threats to the planet, but also the greatest business opportunity of the last 200 years. This year at CogX we will explore the approaches AI and other emerging technologies offer in the fight against climate change and environmental degradation. We will discuss the future of our cities, and the intersection of smart, sustainable and key advances in mobility.
