
                                The idea behind the Global Leadership Summit emerged when we first began planning this year’s event and settled on a core theme for CogX: ‘How can we get the next 10 years right?”
It seemed essential then, but it’s clearly more poignant than ever now. The CogX Global Leadership Summit will bring together thousands of participants to move the conversation forward with concrete actions, to inspire future and current generations of leaders, help reframe the climate emergency as the biggest economic opportunity of the last 200 years, and to minimise the loss of life, suffering and negative impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic.
It will be the first event to connect global leadership with technical expertise and the public at this scale, who must engage in the discussion if we are to get the next 10 years right.
The Summit will run concurrently with the main CogX agenda bringing together over 4,500 of leaders around a programme of online virtual activities including: the Leaders Lounge for peer networking, Chatham House Rule talks, exclusive side events, executive workshops and our new appointment setting concierge service. To make the most of their time at CogX, our team can optionally upgrade and have our meetings team pre-organise meetings before the event.
