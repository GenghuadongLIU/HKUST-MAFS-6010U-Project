Our past winners include DeepMind, UiPath and Unilever. This year, as well as awards for industry, we will look at emerging technology as it impacts the UN Development Goals, where we will be giving out special prizes for impact and delivery.
Itâ€™s the perfect opportunity to rub shoulders with the most senior global leaders community and enjoy a glittering evening of entertainment with the opportunity to honour the companies and individuals who exhibited outstanding achievement in the awards categories.
We will shortly be announcing categories for CogX Awards 2020. Register your interest and be the first to know.
