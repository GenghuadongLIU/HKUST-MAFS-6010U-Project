
                                Virtual CogX has been developed to deliver a best-in-class digital experience. Covering all 16 tracks of content, virtual meet-the-speaker breakout sessions, the eExpo and startup village, invite-only side events, roundtables, affiliate partner workshops and speed networking for each vertical, Virtual CogX aims to set the standard.
