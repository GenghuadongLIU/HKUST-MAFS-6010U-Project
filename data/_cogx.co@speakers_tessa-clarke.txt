                About Tessa
                
                After a 15-year corporate career, Tessa Co-Founded OLIO, the world’s only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, which is solving the problem of household food waste at scale. OLIO has grown to 1.5 million users in just over 3 years and its impact has been widely recognised, most notably by the United Nations who highlighted OLIO as a “beacon” for the world, and by Vivatech who awarded OLIO “Next European Unicorn”.  Tessa is passionate about the sharing economy as a solution for a sustainable world, and about ‘profit with purpose’ as the next business paradigm.
