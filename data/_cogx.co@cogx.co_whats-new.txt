
                                The fourth edition of the award-winning CogX event will include two new elements – Virtual CogX and the Global Leadership Summit – that will make it the biggest, most inclusive and comprehensive interactive online event experience of its kind.
Virtual CogX has been developed to deliver a best-in-class digital experience. Covering all 16 tracks of content, virtual meet-the-speaker breakout sessions, the vExpo and startup village, invite-only side events, roundtables, affiliate partner workshops and speed networking for each vertical, Virtual CogX aims to set the standard. Participants will be able to take part regardless of where they are in the world, making CogX accessible to a much bigger national, and global, audience.
The CogX Global Leadership Summit will also be accessible as a virtual event connecting 4,500 global leaders to move the conversation forward with concrete actions, to inspire future and current generations of leaders, help reframe the climate emergency as the biggest economic opportunity of the last 200 years.
In addition, the CogX Health track will have a deep focus on the critical and urgent issues surrounding the global COVID-19 pandemic: the lessons learned, challenges ahead, opportunities to reduce suffering and save lives, and what solutions are available.
