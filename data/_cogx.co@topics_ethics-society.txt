Curated with the Ada Lovelace Institute, this stage reminds us that despite the countless positive benefits that technology brings, we need to remain vigilant that developments and deployments are ethical, equitable and safe.
From algorithmic bias to unintended consequences, from trustworthy data governance to using technology to exit from the COVID-19 crisis, from the broader impacts tech disruption is having on society to the need for citizensâ€™ voices to be heard, this stage examines recent developments and challenges to our understanding of ethics and technology.
