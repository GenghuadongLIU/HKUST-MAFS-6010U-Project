We’re expecting 30,000 people to attend our virtual festival on June 8-10 exploring topics from planet, leadership, cutting edge technology, ethics and the future of work. We’re running a GenZ stage and we’d love to hear what kinds of talks you’d like to see on it.
Fill out this form, and send us your ideas. We’ll send you a free pass to log on to the festival. And, if we love your ideas, we’d love your help putting the session together and running it.
