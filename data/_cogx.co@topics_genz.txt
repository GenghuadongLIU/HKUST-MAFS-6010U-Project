                            Hear from GenZers themselves as they highlight the topics that matter most to them and witness the ingenuity that’s flourishing amongst the Teens in AI Community. The winners from their recent hackathon will present their projects addressing the Corona Virus Crisis. There will also be sessions for GenZers hosted by experts from across the festival who will share their knowledge and experience for students. How to get a job in tech, mindblowing applications and roles for the non-technical, talks will be complimented by a Q&A hours where the audience can quiz these leaders themselves.
