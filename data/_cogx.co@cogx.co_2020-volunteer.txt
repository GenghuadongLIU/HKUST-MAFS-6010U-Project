
                                As you know, CogX is the world’s biggest, most inclusive and forward-thinking gathering of Leaders, CEOs, Entrepreneurs, Academics and Activists asking the question: how do we get the next 10 years right?  We are expecting 30,000+ virtual visitors this year across our 18 stages and 100 side events.
The festival is not possible without our incredible group of people to deliver the event over the years and we are keen to involve you as we navigate the virtual scene.
We are looking for an amazing group of tech savvy and energetic individuals to help us pull off the biggest virtual gathering and ensure the smooth running of the festival. If you are interested in being a part of the team then please fill out this very short form.
Looking forward to (virtually) meeting you all and welcoming you to the team!
If you have any questions, please get in touch with the CogX team by sending us an email.
